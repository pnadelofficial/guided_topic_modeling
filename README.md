This repository contains an implementation of the work presented as part of the Topic Modeling in the Age of Artificial Intelligence session at the Boston Digital Humanities Symposium (April 12, 2024).

## Abstract
Topic modeling has been an enticing approach to large datasets for researchers in the social sciences and humanities. Our Guided Topic Modeling (GTM) approach seeks to employ a large language model to mediate a natural language description of a researcher’s theory and high dimensional representations of document chunks. Our case study examines the complex discursive process by which diseases acquire identities. First, we explore the meaning of the concept ‘disease identity’ drawing on the secondary literature in several disciplines. Second, we employ the resultant theoretical insights in a comparative study of how perceptions of two viruses, Hepatitis C and HIV, and the people who suffer from them, evolve over time in both the US and UK. We draw on multiple sources of data, including primary documents from archival research, testimonies to Public Inquiries, press reviews in both countries, and oral histories/interviews. A general framework for how to apply GTM will be provided to attendees via a GitHub repository.
